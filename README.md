# Prakash Tour & Travels — Booking & Travel Management System

Sasaram, Bihar. A real, database-backed booking and travel management
system: customer website, secure booking/payment flow, and an owner
admin panel — running as a single persistent Node/Express service,
deployable on Koyeb via Docker.

## Architecture

```
Customer Website (static html/css/js)
        ↕
Express server (server.js) — one persistent Node process
        ↕
PostgreSQL via Prisma (prisma/schema.prisma)
        ↕
Admin Panel (admin.html)
        ↕
Resend or Gmail/SMTP (transactional email) · Vercel Blob (receipts) · Razorpay (optional online payment) · Cash (advance/final)
```

Bookings, payments, vehicles, drivers, invoices, email history, and audit
logs all live in Postgres — nothing business-critical is stored in
`localStorage`. See `STATUS.md` for exactly what's implemented and what's
left before a real launch.

## Payment methods

Customers can pay the advance or final amount three ways, all on the
same secure `/payment/:token` page:
1. **Online gateway** (Razorpay) — instant, signature-verified server-side. Only shown if `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`/`SECRET` are configured.
2. **Manual UPI + receipt upload** — always available. Admin verifies the screenshot.
3. **Cash** — always available. Customer declares intent to pay cash; admin confirms collection from the **Cash Payments** page (or the booking detail view) once received.

All three feed into the same underlying `Payment` record and
verification pipeline — admin approval updates booking/payment status
identically regardless of method.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # fill in DATABASE_URL at minimum
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npm run dev              # starts server.js on http://localhost:3000
```

Static pages work without a database, but booking/payment/admin flows
need `DATABASE_URL` set and migrated.

## Deploying to Koyeb

See **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** for the full walkthrough. Short version:

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Koyeb → **Create Service → GitHub** → this repo → Docker builder is
   auto-detected from the `Dockerfile`.
3. Set environment variables (`.env.example` has the full list).
4. Deploy, then run `npx prisma migrate deploy` against production
   `DATABASE_URL`, then bootstrap the first admin via `/api/admin/init`.

## Environment variables

Nothing works end-to-end without real config — there is no
placeholder/demo mode. `.env.example` documents every variable
(database, admin session secret, Vercel Blob, Resend or SMTP, optional
Razorpay, cron). Copy it to `.env` for local dev; set the same keys as
Koyeb service environment variables (mark secrets as **Secret** type) for
production.
